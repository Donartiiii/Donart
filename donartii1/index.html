          <h2>cardio</h2>
          <p>Cardio is defined as any type of exercise that gets your heart rate up and keeps it up for a prolonged period of time. Your respiratory system will start working harder as you begin to breathe faster and more deeply. </p>

          <h2>loose weight</h2>
          <p> Even modest weight loss can mean big benefits. Even a modest weight loss of 5% to 10% of your total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars</p>

          <p>Eating more frequently. Slowly begin to eat 5 to 6 smaller meals during the day. ...
Choosing food with lots of nutrients. Set up a routine to eat and drink things you like and that have a lot of nutrients as well as calories. </p>

          <h2>add muscle</h2>
          <p>The solution is to lift weights — often enough, long enough, and heavy enough. "Weight training is the best way to keep the muscle mass you have and even increase muscle mass you may have lost with aging," says Shawn Pedicini, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital</p>

            <p>
For those who have trouble eating enough during the day, mass gainer supplements offer a convenient and effective way to boost calorie intake. Unlike typical protein powders, mass gainers are rich not only in protein but also in carbs and sometimes in other ingredients, such as healthy fats</p>

            <h1>creatine</h1>

            <p>Creatine is an amino acid located mostly in your body's muscles as well as in the brain. Most people get creatine through seafood and red meat — though at levels far below those found in synthetically made creatine supplements. The body's liver, pancreas and kidneys also can make about 1 gram of creatine per day.
